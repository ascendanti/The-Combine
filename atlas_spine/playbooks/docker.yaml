name: Docker Issues
description: Docker container and network problems

patterns:
  - "connection refused"
  - "port is already allocated"
  - "no such container"
  - "cannot connect to docker"
  - "image not found"
  - "network not found"
  - "host.docker.internal"

diagnosis: |
  Docker issues often stem from:
  1. Docker Desktop not running
  2. Port already in use
  3. Container not started
  4. Network isolation (use host.docker.internal)
  5. Wrong image tag

fix: |
  1. Start Docker Desktop
  2. Check running: docker ps
  3. Check port: netstat -an | findstr :8080
  4. From container to host: use host.docker.internal
  5. Rebuild: docker-compose build --no-cache

commands:
  - 'docker ps'
  - 'docker-compose ps'
  - 'docker logs <container>'
  - 'netstat -an | findstr :8080'
  - 'docker network ls'
