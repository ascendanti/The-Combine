name: Windows Path Issues
description: Common Windows path and command issues

patterns:
  - "is not recognized"
  - "cannot find the path"
  - "source is not recognized"
  - "the system cannot find"
  - "access is denied"
  - "no such file or directory"

diagnosis: |
  Windows path issues typically occur due to:
  1. Missing quotes around paths with spaces
  2. Wrong slash direction (use \ or /)
  3. Missing environment variable
  4. Execution policy blocking scripts

fix: |
  1. Wrap paths in quotes: "C:\Users\Name\folder"
  2. Use forward slashes in git bash: /c/Users/Name
  3. Check PATH: echo %PATH%
  4. For .ps1 scripts: Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser

commands:
  - 'echo %PATH%'
  - 'where python'
  - 'Get-ExecutionPolicy'
  - 'dir /b'
