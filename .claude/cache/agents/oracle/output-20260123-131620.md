# Research Report: Semantic Retrieval / RAG Repositories Comparison
Generated: 2026-01-23

## Summary

Five RAG/semantic retrieval tools were evaluated for academic paper processing with formulas. **Paper-QA** is the clear winner for academic use cases - it has explicit math equation support (added Dec 2025), citation-aware retrieval, and local LLM support. For fully local operation with no cloud dependencies, **UltraRAG-Vis** offers unique visual embedding that bypasses OCR formula extraction issues entirely.
