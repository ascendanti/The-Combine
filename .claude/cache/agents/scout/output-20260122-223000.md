## Executive Summary

Analyzed 38 repositories in Reverse Engineer folder. Found 4 production-ready frameworks, 1 failed mega-integration, and 33 additional tools.

### Top Findings

1. Continuous-Claude-v3: 32 agents, 109 skills, 30 hooks - 95% token savings
2. claude-code-auto-memory: Auto CLAUDE.md sync, zero-config
3. n8n-mcp: Workflow automation bridge (1,084 nodes)
4. SuperClaude: PM Agent patterns with confidence checking
5. ATLAS-CLAUDE: Failed mega-integration (Windows path issues, port conflicts)

## Category 1: Production-Ready Frameworks

### 1.1 Continuous-Claude-v3 (Priority 1)

Core: 32 agents, 109 skills, 30 hooks, TLDR analysis, PostgreSQL memory, handoffs
Integration: hooks + PostgreSQL Docker + Python scripts
Dependencies: Python 3.11+, uv, Docker, Node.js
Complexity: HIGH (12-step wizard, DB migrations)
Value: 95% token savings, cross-session learning, workflows
Status: Active, 1250+ stars

### 1.2 claude-code-auto-memory (Priority 2)

Core: Auto CLAUDE.md sync, marker-based updates, git integration
Integration: PostToolUse/Stop hooks, isolated agent
Dependencies: Node.js only
Complexity: LOW (single command install)
Value: Zero maintenance, 99.6% token savings for CLAUDE.md
Status: Active, marketplace

### 1.3 n8n-mcp (Priority 3)

Core: 1084 n8n nodes, MCP server, 2709 templates, validation
Integration: MCP server (stdio/HTTP), Claude Desktop config
Dependencies: Node.js, optional n8n API
Complexity: LOW (npx or Docker)
Value: Workflow automation, template discovery
Status: Active, 3336 tests

### 1.4 SuperClaude (Priority 4)

Core: PM Agent confidence checking, parallel execution
Integration: Python package, slash commands
Dependencies: Python 3.8+, uv, pytest
Complexity: MEDIUM
Value: Pre-execution confidence, testing integration
Status: Active, v4.2.0

## Category 2: Failed - ATLAS-CLAUDE

Attempted: Combine claude-flow, Continuous-Claude, SuperClaude, claude-mem, sleepless-agent

Why Failed:
1. Windows path issues (spaces in Program Files)
2. Port conflicts (37777)
3. Service dependency chaos
4. Namespace collisions
5. O(n²) integration debt

Error Evidence:
- 'C:\Program' is not recognized (path escaping)
- EADDRINUSE port 37777 (port conflict)

Lesson: Integrate incrementally, not mega-merge

Recommendation: DO NOT USE - cherry-pick components separately

## Category 3: Integration Strategy

Phase 1 (Week 1-2): Continuous-Claude + auto-memory (~1.5h install)
Phase 2 (Week 3): n8n-mcp (~15min)
Phase 3 (Week 4+): SuperClaude (~20min)
Phase 4 (Month 2+): Evaluate 33 other tools per need

Total Phase 1-3: ~2 hours

## Category 4: Integration Patterns

RECOMMENDED:
- Hook-Based (Continuous-Claude, auto-memory): Non-invasive, composable
- MCP Server (n8n-mcp): Standard protocol, isolated
- Python Package (SuperClaude): Testable, version-managed
- Agent/Skill Files: Simple, no dependencies

USE WITH CAUTION:
- Service-Based (claude-mem, sleepless-agent): Port conflicts, Windows issues

AVOID:
- Mega-Integration (ATLAS-CLAUDE): Integration debt, unmaintainable

## Category 5: Decision Matrix

| Need | Use | Don't Use |
|------|-----|-----------|
| Token efficiency | Continuous-Claude | - |
| Context preservation | Continuous-Claude | claude-mem |
| Auto CLAUDE.md | auto-memory | - |
| Workflows | n8n-mcp | - |
| Confidence | SuperClaude | - |
| Cross-session learning | Continuous-Claude | OpenMemory |

## Category 6: Red Flags & Success Patterns

RED FLAGS (from ATLAS-CLAUDE):
1. Windows paths with spaces (quote paths)
2. Hardcoded ports (use dynamic allocation)
3. No service orchestration (need systemd/Docker Compose)
4. O(n²) integration (integrate incrementally)

SUCCESS PATTERNS:
1. Incremental adoption (Continuous-Claude wizard)
2. Zero-config default (auto-memory)
3. Standard protocols (n8n-mcp MCP)
4. Testing-first (all frameworks have tests)

## Appendix A: Framework Comparison

| Framework | Agents | Skills | Hooks | Database | Complexity | Status |
|-----------|--------|--------|-------|----------|------------|--------|
| Continuous-Claude | 32 | 109 | 30 | PostgreSQL | HIGH | Production |
| auto-memory | 1 | 2 | 2 | None | LOW | Production |
| n8n-mcp | 0 | 0 | 0 | SQLite | LOW | Production |
| SuperClaude | 0 | 3 | 0 | None | MEDIUM | Production |
| ATLAS-CLAUDE | 86+ | 109+ | 30+ | 3 DBs | EXTREME | Failed |

## Appendix B: Token Savings

Continuous-Claude TLDR:
- Without: 23,000 tokens/file x 10 = 230,000 (compaction after 9)
- With: 1,200 tokens/file x 10 = 12,000 (19x more files)
- Savings: 95%

auto-memory:
- Without: ~12,000 tokens per CLAUDE.md update
- With: ~50 tokens (isolated agent)
- Savings: 99.6%

## Appendix C: Other Tools (33 total)

HIGH VALUE (evaluate after Phase 4):
- agents-main, awesome-claude-skills-master, claude-skills-toolkit
- obsidian-skills-main, deep-reading-analyst-skill-main

MEDIUM VALUE (per use case):
- bytebot-main, cc-caffeine-main, claude-dashboard-main
- claude-equity-research, claude-quant, CodeStory-main
- humanlayer-main, mcp-desktop-agent-main

LOW PRIORITY (niche or overlapping):
- 23 other tools (domain-specific, platform-specific, or duplicate functionality)

## Final Recommendations

IMMEDIATE (This Week):
1. Install Continuous-Claude-v3 (focus core features, skip optional APIs)
2. Install claude-code-auto-memory (single command)
3. Evaluate n8n-mcp if workflow automation needed

SHORT-TERM (This Month):
4. Test SuperClaude confidence patterns
5. Cherry-pick skills from awesome-claude-skills

AVOID:
- ATLAS-CLAUDE (failed)
- claude-mem (duplicates Continuous-Claude)
- Mega-integrations

QUESTIONS TO ANSWER:
1. Need workflow automation? (n8n-mcp decision)
2. Need 24/7 autonomous? (research alternatives)
3. Domain-specific needs? (evaluate domain tools)
4. Windows or Linux primary? (affects service-based tools)
