      - Phase 15: Multi-Agent Architecture added (4 subsections)
      - Cost/Benefit Matrix updated
      - Active Phases roadmap updated
      - Current Status updated

  - task.md Updated:
      - Research findings summary table
      - Next actions clarified

in_progress:
  - PDF Ingestion:
      status: "28 papers remaining"
      container: "autonomous-ingest running"
      bottleneck: "LocalAI LLM speed - needs Phase 13.1 optimizations"

blocked: []

phase_13_applied:
  "13.1 CPU Optimization":
    - docker-compose THREADS: 4 → 10 (2.5x CPU utilization)
    - LocalAI restarted with new config
    - Limitation: CPU-only (no GPU on host)

  "13.3 Dragonfly LLM Cache":
    - Added redis client to autonomous_ingest.py
    - 3 LLM call sites now check cache before calling LocalAI
    - make_prompt_hash() for deterministic cache keys
    - cache_llm_response() / get_cached_llm_response() helpers
    - Cache TTL: 24 hours (LLM_CACHE_TTL = 86400)
    - Dockerfile updated with redis dependency
    - docker-compose passes DRAGONFLY_URL to container

phase_13_not_applied:
  - Smaller model (NuExtract/Phi-3-mini) - requires download time
  - Flash Attention - requires GPU
  - gpu_layers - requires GPU
  - vLLM - requires GPU

current_status:
  - autonomous-ingest processing 12 remaining papers
  - Dragonfly LLM cache active (keys: llm:ingest:*)
  - Expected 60-90% savings on repeated LLM queries

next_steps:
  - Monitor cache hit rate as papers process
  - Consider downloading smaller model (Phi-3-mini 3.8B) for faster CPU inference
  - Phase 14: Delta-based handoffs for context efficiency

key_decisions:
  - Rejected complex MAS/GA approach for 44-paper corpus
  - Root cause is memory bandwidth (decode phase), not compute
  - Use existing Dragonfly instead of adding Redis
  - NuExtract-v1.5 preferred for claim extraction (purpose-built)
  - gRPC preferred over REST for agent-to-agent (60% lower latency)
