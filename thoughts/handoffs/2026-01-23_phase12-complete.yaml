context_usage: "moderate"

completed:
  - Phase 10.4 Claim Classification:
      - UTFClaim extended with slug_code, taxonomy_tags
      - claim_similarity.py for cross-paper matching
      - UTF closeness values implemented
      - Obsidian export with classification metadata

  - Phase 12.1 Bisimulation Foundation:
      - daemon/bisimulation.py (500+ lines)
      - BisimulationState and BisimulationMetric dataclasses
      - Goal-conditioned distance computation
      - State abstraction (equivalence classes)
      - Policy transfer validation

  - Phase 12.2 Goal-Conditioned RL:
      - daemon/gcrl.py (500+ lines)
      - Hindsight Experience Replay (HER)
      - Causal factor extraction
      - Policy learning from trajectories
      - Virtual experience generation

  - Phase 12.4 Integration Wiring:
      - coherence.py: find_similar_goals(), suggest_policy_transfer()
      - decisions.py: get_policy_guided_decision(), record_outcome_with_trajectory()
      - decisions.py: find_similar_decisions()

  - Infrastructure:
      - Freqtrade module added as git submodule
      - Container rebuilt with claim classification
      - All modules tested and working

in_progress:
  - PDF Ingestion:
      status: "35 files remaining"
      container: "autonomous-ingest running"
      features: "UTF schema + claim classification enabled"

blocked: []

next_steps:
  - Connect claim_similarity to memory.py for semantic retrieval
  - Dashboard visualization of state abstractions
  - Metrics collection (Transfer Rate, Abstraction Ratio, HER improvement)
  - Monitor PDF ingest completion
  - Phase 11 Adaptive Learning (when ready)

key_decisions:
  - Bisimulation uses weighted composite: 40% features, 20% reward, 30% actions, 10% goal
  - GCRL hindsight relabeling creates synthetic goals from achieved states
  - Integration keeps modules loosely coupled (try/except imports)

files_created:
  - daemon/bisimulation.py
  - daemon/gcrl.py
  - daemon/claim_similarity.py
  - daemon/freqtrade_bridge.py (on hold per user request)
  - thoughts/handoffs/2026-01-23_phase12-complete.yaml

files_modified:
  - daemon/utf_extractor.py (slug_code, taxonomy_tags, classification prompts)
  - daemon/coherence.py (bisimulation integration)
  - daemon/decisions.py (GCRL integration)
  - EVOLUTION-PLAN.md (Phase 12 added)
  - task.md (Phase 12 progress)

notes:
  - User requested Telegram updates only for phase completions
  - Freqtrade integration module created but set aside until requested
  - PDF ingest container uses new classification (Pass 5)
  - All cognitive modules now interconnected
