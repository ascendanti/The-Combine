context: Assessing resources for Phase 10 (Ascension)

user_directive: |
  "Assess overlap and benefit from everything-claude-code-main"
  "Find folder suitable for deep analysis and low-token information intake"
  Focus: self-improvement loop, cross-session learning, emergent behavior

assessment_summary: |
  Two key resources identified:
  1. everything-claude-code-main: Continuous-learning skill for automated pattern extraction
  2. deep-reading-analyst-skill-main: 10 thinking frameworks for systematic deep analysis

github_status:
  remote_combine: "Added https://github.com/ascendanti/The-Combine.git"
  ready_for_push: false
  reason: "Phase 10 implementation not yet tested"

completed_this_session:
  - Integrated deep-reading-analyst skill (10 thinking frameworks)
  - Integrated continuous-learning skill
  - Created daemon/self_improvement.py (First Principles + Inversion + Systems)
  - Updated CLAUDE.md with algorithmic habits and iterative behavior
  - Tested self-improvement module (working)

next_session:
  - Wire continuous-learning as Stop hook
  - Test pattern extraction on actual session logs
  - Run full daemon stack test
  - Push tested version to The-Combine repo
