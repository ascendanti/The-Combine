context_usage: "moderate"

completed:
  - Phase 12.4 Memory Integration:
      - memory.py: Added claim similarity integration
      - recall_similar_claims(), get_cross_paper_insights()
      - get_related_claims(), get_claim_clusters()
      - refresh_claim_index() for rebuilding
      - CLI commands: claims, cross-paper, clusters, refresh-claims

  - Phase 12.4 SQLite Save Fix:
      - autonomous_ingest.py: Added store_utf_to_sqlite()
      - init_utf_db() creates sources, claims, concepts, excerpts tables
      - Container rebuilt and restarted

  - Phase 12.4 Dashboard Visualization:
      - api.py: Added 5 new endpoints
        - /abstractions (state abstraction classes)
        - /transfers (policy transfer history)
        - /claims/clusters
        - /claims/cross-paper
        - /claims/search
      - bisimulation.py: get_state_abstractions(), get_recent_transfers()
      - dashboard.html: 3 new cards (Abstractions, Transfers, Clusters)

  - Phase 13 Planning:
      - Assessed Telegram proposal (Multi-Agent Swarm with GA)
      - Counter-proposed simpler solution focusing on actual bottleneck (LLM)
      - Added Phase 13 to EVOLUTION-PLAN with optimized approach

in_progress:
  - PDF Ingestion:
      status: "28 papers remaining"
      container: "autonomous-ingest running (slow - LocalAI bottleneck)"
      current: "GCHR Goal-Conditioned Hindsight paper at Pass 2"

blocked: []

next_steps:
  - Monitor PDF ingest completion
  - Phase 13.1: Implement batch LLM prompts
  - Phase 13.2: Add Dragonfly LLM response caching
  - Complete remaining metrics (Transfer Rate, Abstraction Ratio)

key_decisions:
  - Counter-proposed simpler Phase 13 over complex MAS/GA approach
  - Root cause: LocalAI LLM speed, not parsing/embedding
  - Use existing Dragonfly instead of adding Redis
  - Avoid over-engineering for 44-paper corpus

files_created:
  - thoughts/handoffs/2026-01-24_phase12-dashboard.yaml

files_modified:
  - daemon/memory.py (claim similarity integration)
  - daemon/autonomous_ingest.py (SQLite save, UTF_DB_PATH)
  - daemon/api.py (5 new endpoints)
  - daemon/bisimulation.py (dashboard query methods)
  - daemon/dashboard.html (3 new cards)
  - EVOLUTION-PLAN.md (Phase 12.4 complete, Phase 13 planned)

notes:
  - Container needs time - LocalAI processes ~1 paper per 5-10 mins
  - Claim index will populate as papers complete
  - Dashboard accessible at http://localhost:5000 when api.py running
