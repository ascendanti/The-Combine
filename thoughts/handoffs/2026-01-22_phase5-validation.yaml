summary: |
  Phase 5 validation session. Fixed Skill permissions, tested OpenMemory,
  daemon queue, and discovered UTF research library. System fully operational.

completed:
  - Fixed Skill permission (was only allowing confidence-check, now all skills)
  - Verified OpenMemory backend is active and working
  - Tested memory store/recall cycle successfully
  - Tested daemon task queue lifecycle (add, in_progress, complete)
  - Discovered UTF research library (45+ papers on continual learning, coherence)
  - Checked thoughts/ directory structure

in_progress: []

blocked: []

completed_this_session:
  - Fixed Skill permissions (all skills enabled)
  - OpenMemory backend verified working
  - Daemon queue lifecycle tested
  - Handoff system tested
  - UTF validation completed (strong fit for unified personal AI)
  - Token efficiency rules added
  - Parallel agent defaults established
  - Integrated deep-reading-analyst skill (10+ thinking frameworks)
  - Integrated quant-methodology and risk simulator

next_steps:
  - Test quant risk simulator with real data
  - Build Goal Coherence Layer (from UTF validation)
  - Create module templates for Calendar, Finance, Tasks
  - Set up GitHub async integration
  - Explore Docker deployment for 24/7 operation

context:
  evolution_phase: 5
  evolution_status: "validation in progress"
  memory_backend: openmemory
  daemon_status: queue working, runner not tested live

  reference_frameworks:
    integrated:
      - Continuous-Claude-v3
      - claude-code-auto-memory
      - sleepless-agent patterns
      - OpenMemory SDK
    available: 36 frameworks in Reverse Engineer/

  utf_research:
    location: C:\Users\New Employee\Desktop\UTF
    papers: 45+
    key_topics:
      - Continual reinforcement learning
      - Goal-conditioned RL
      - Topological data analysis
      - AI coherence and bounded rationality
      - Recursive Coherence Principle

decisions:
  - Skill: Changed from Skill(confidence-check) to Skill (all skills enabled)
  - Autonomy: Full autonomy mode confirmed per autonomous-operation.md rule

learnings:
  - OpenMemory backend auto-selects when openmemory-py is installed
  - Queue.py fully functional for async task management
  - UTF folder contains theoretical framework research for future integration
